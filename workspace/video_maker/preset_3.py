Related to stoic and no fear benifit guides.

- This will be 100 percent automated and even the channel fetch flow
    will be automated. Note- automation is only for the stoic and no fear cases.

- End case -> Upload the video from url directly. Meanwhile audit pipeline can be setup
    to allow us to modify the text as well as the image.
- Meanwhile send an alert for trending video automatically via email.
  This is gonna be built seperately and will be run as a cron. Whenever
  the video which is trending appears.
- A singal is generated to a chat space.
Along with the url.
Then from my end, I just have to enter the URL into my channel 
so that I can make the video on the fly.
- Finally research Item appearing from this is CGP/easy actually /3b1brown type videos
    which is also narration but not sure on how to do it,
Keep it different from preset_1/preset_2
You should also automate upload to private using youtube API
To be in same channel as quotes
